# Planetside: Forever auto-install script for Linux

There's not much to say about this script. It's mostly for Ubuntu version 20-23. It could work on other distros perhaps. Haven't bothered testing it.

It's kind of basic. It's not at all like a fancy script most batch programmers would make because I don't program in batch. So I took a bulk of commands and threaded them together into one batch file. Yes the working of postgres' database was weird but it has succeeded for the most part.

Comment from a user of the script:
